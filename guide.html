        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Building your own PC can be a rewarding and cost-effective experience. This guide will walk you through every step, from selecting components to powering up your finished build. A DIY PC allows for customization, future upgrades, and can save money compared to pre-built options.</p>
        
        <h2 id="components">Understanding PC Components</h2>
        <h3>1. CPU (Processor)</h3>
        <p>The CPU is the brain of your computer. Choose a processor that fits your needs, whether for gaming, productivity, or general use.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AMD Ryzen:</strong> Great for multitasking and gaming.</li>
            <li><strong>Intel Core:</strong> Excellent single-threaded performance.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Motherboard</h3>
        <p>The motherboard connects all your components. Ensure compatibility with your CPU and RAM.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form Factor:</strong> ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX.</li>
            <li><strong>Socket Type:</strong> Matches your CPU (e.g., AM5, LGA 1700).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. RAM (Memory)</h3>
        <p>RAM temporarily stores data for quick access. Aim for at least 16GB for gaming or productivity.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Storage</h3>
        <p>Storage holds your operating system and files. Use a mix of SSD for speed and HDD for capacity.</p>
        
        <h3>5. GPU (Graphics Card)</h3>
        <p>Essential for gaming and rendering graphics.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>NVIDIA GeForce:</strong> Popular for gaming and video editing.</li>
            <li><strong>AMD Radeon:</strong> Great value and performance.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>6. PSU (Power Supply Unit)</h3>
        <p>The PSU powers your entire system. Choose one with enough wattage and certification (80+ Bronze, Gold).</p>
        
        <h3>7. Cooling Systems</h3>
        <p>Air coolers are budget-friendly, while liquid coolers offer better thermal performance.</p>
        
        <h2 id="assembly">Assembling Your PC</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace</h3>
        <p>Ensure a clean, static-free environment. Gather all tools, including a screwdriver and anti-static wrist strap.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Install the CPU</h3>
        <p>Gently place the CPU into the motherboard socket, aligning the triangle indicators.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Attach CPU Cooler</h3>
        <p>Secure the cooler over the CPU and connect it to the motherboard fan header.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Install RAM</h3>
        <p>Insert RAM sticks into the DIMM slots, ensuring they click into place.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 5: Install Storage</h3>
        <p>Secure SSDs/HDDs into their respective slots and connect them to the motherboard.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 6: Install GPU</h3>
        <p>Insert the GPU into the PCIe slot and secure it with screws.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 7: Connect PSU</h3>
        <p>Attach power cables to all components and motherboard headers.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 8: Cable Management</h3>
        <p>Organize cables for proper airflow and aesthetics.</p>
        
        <h2 id="tips">Additional Tips</h2>
        <p>1. Double-check all connections before powering on.</p>
        <p>2. Update BIOS for compatibility.</p>
        <p>3. Install necessary drivers after booting up.</p>
